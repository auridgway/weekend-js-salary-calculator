## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

We needed to recreate a calculator based on an image, with some logic that would track the people we add and let us know when we're overbudget.

Initially I thought I had it down with using global arrays but realized my array wasn't initializing like I wanted it to. Instead I purely reference the information on the HTML page using DOM. This made things much simpler however there was some text formatting needing to be done to get things to work the way they needed to.
